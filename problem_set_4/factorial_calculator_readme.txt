Programming Language: Python 3.9.1

Programming Description: This program will print the factorial of an
integer and display the expanded form of the factorial (e.g. the expanded
form of 4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4) The program will prompt the user to input an
integer and will then calculate and print the factorial.

Program Assumptions: In order to display the factorial, the user must
input a valid number (an integer greater than or equal to zero). Fluency of 
English is another assumption because all the prompts are written in English.

Features of the Program: To ensure the user understands what a factorial is, a
definition along with an example is provided at the start of the program.

Restrictions: While there are no restrictions on size of integer that the user 
can input, it is not reccomended to input very large values such as 1000000 because
it will take a relatively long time to compute and print the expanded form of
the factorial.

Known Errors: If the user inputs an integer that is larger than 20000, there
will be a noticeable waiting time before the factorial is printed because the
number is that large. While this is not technically an error, if the user inputs
an extremely large integer, the program may cause the computer to freeze.
