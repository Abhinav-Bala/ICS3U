Programming Description: This program will first ask the user to input an initial
amount of names. Then it will present the user with a variety of options including
the ability to add, remove, edit a name in the name bank.

Program Assumptions: In order to work properly, the user must input a valid name 
when prompted. Additionally, the user must enter a valid integer to perform an action.
It is also assumed that the user understands that names only contain letters in the English
alphabet. Fluency of English is another assumption because all the prompts are written in English.

Features of the Program:  In addition to first names, this name bank also stores the last names
of users and provides detailed instructions throughout the program. The menus are also visually
appealing to ensure for maximum user experience. Furthermore, the user can decide how many names
to input initially.

Restrictions: Once an action has been selected, the user must complete it before being able to quit
the program. Additionally, the user must input an initial amount of names before being able to quit.
The program does not allow the user to input names with hyphens or any other non-english alaphabet
characters.
